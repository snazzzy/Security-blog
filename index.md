Biometrics dehumanizes people. Essentially reduces a complex human to data points. Essentially this is authentication. Can we rely on biometric data? As we become more reliant on technology, they technology may be flawed, therefore our decisions are flawed. Can biometric tech be used as an extra step in our current ways of identification. Resulting in a more streamlined process. The argument that biometrics dehumanize people is interesting to me. I personally don’t find it an issue if me as a person is summed up into data points. I am not saying I agree with widespread use of biometric identification. In a perfect world if biometric data was used responsibly and had no technical flaws, I don’t have an issue being summed up into data points. I don’t that to be my identity, I don’t think of passwords as my identity. I don’t think of my social security number as my identity. I am interested 

What about non collision hashes for biometric data? Keep the positives of the authentication via Biometric tech while maintaining anonymity. I think if there was an opt in service where biometric data were to be used, it should maintain a form of anonymity. Again I am maintaining that there should be a process for identity that is paired with biometrics, as we cant solely make our decisions based on a flawed technology.

Immigration in South America seems extremely messed up compared to the united states. Using ID cards to separate the population based on the tone of their skin. Sometimes people would get reclassified. This had insane consequences as it heavily changed people’s lives. The South American government used an weird classification method. It was first used to classify animals. Basically, different genres. This was a very old approach, and they applied it to people. I cannot believe that they didn’t allow different classifications of people to marry. Applying race based on the color of a persons skin isn’t even scientifically accurate. The article showed an example of a boxer being re classified from white to a different classification right before a big match. He lost everything right before the match. Was the cauterization used to oppress people? In relation to the US census, I think that it is used for demographic understanding. I think the main point of this article is that we need to be careful of placing labels on people. When you put labels on people, it can be dehumanizing. Another key point of that this article said was that applying labels to groups of people may disenfranchise other groups.

This week reading was about security tools and encryption. How everyday persons not involved deeply in technology and security use security tools in their lives. People do not know the interquel details of how encryption works, and nor should they. The studies in the readings indicated that most people didn’t value security, and just widely accepted that everyone worked, and designers spent just as much time as the functionality of their application as they did on security. I find this reading heavily relates to the ethnography in technology. The use of technology between cultures and countries are not the same. They are viewed differently, and an actor theory network map might not have the same results in different cultures. 

Encryption is extremely important tool, as it insures privacy. In the readings, users were not sure the basics of encryption and they use it every day. I think the example of score cards rating the applications use and quality of the encryption is a great idea to help everyday consumers. Consumers should not have to read the intricate details of how key exchanges work. The score should be expanded to incorporate a set of security tests that the application should withstand. This could be a governing body attached to application stores like apple store or google store. It would be impossible and extremely costly to perform tests on all applications on the store, and it would also hurt the small developers. However the security score cards could be an amazing idea for the popular applications that millions of people use. If an application reaches a certain mass of users, they will have to subject their application to a security test. 

Billions of people have driven cars, but all of them do not know the mechanical components of their cars. The argument that consumers knowing the details of encryption is pointless. Also, there is a point that is brought up in the reading that people are just lazy and they don’t care. If the applications function like they need it to, most people are not going to dig deep into its security components. Even if the application has a very low security score (on our imaginary security scoring system for applications) they may not want to find a new application and learn how to use it. Given that point, I think the most important solution is to prove to consumers that their security has value.

This weeks readings asks the question, what will the internet be like in the future, and who will shape it. ARPANET was the beginning of the internet, connecting computer systems together around the world, and it was “pure and simple”. Now the scope of todays internet is massive. One big discussion is the fact that billion dollar companies are gaining control of the internet. Not control of the internet like banning where you can and cant navigate to using rules, but more of a monopoly. Many believe that these companies have too much control and are abusing their power. One idea was creating a democratic internet, where large companies did not have so much power. Where amazon was not the one stop shop, and customers would go to other websites as well to purchase their items. Disney now has a mind-blowingly amount of companies. Just look at this diagram!

The internet is where it is today because of consumerism. I think harsh regulation is not the answer. If consumers use a website or service because they enjoy the platform, users should not be forced to navigate elsewhere. Most companies exist because they invented a service or solved a problem. Competition breeds innovation. I do not think it is right for large companies to continually buy out smaller startups, as they no longer have to compete. I think it is important for the government or a controlling body to steer the internet in a way that’s best for the masses. Apply regulation and fines for privacy and security. Enforce a right to compete standard that eliminates mass buyouts of companies. 

It is important to have a controlling body though. As the world of internet of things devices are Everly increasing, protocol standards and security regulations are extremely important.

Ethnography, the study of interactions and reactions of different social cultures. Researchers need to gather observations, interviews, and documentary data for detailed accounts of different social phenomena. When companies are close to the final release of a product, they try to have unbiased test groups come in to use their product. Their reactions are important to judge how close the product is for release. However, I never have thought about Ethnography in relation to technology. How one service or application can work great in the united states, but the success my not work in other countries. It is helpful when releasing products and services in different countries. I see this being an important stage when developing a hacker methodology map, as discussed in my previous post. Paul Dourish brings up the use of Ethnography and points out that it is hard to pinpoint where the reactions come from. 

You cant just be a “tape recorder”, a ethnographer must go more in depth. Subjectivity is an important aspect while being an ethnographer. If data is just collected, it is too hard to correctly identify what stemmed from where. It is noted that engineers tend to leave subjectivity out of ethnography.  

Many tech companies today employ lots of ethnographers, as they want to perform product research, and find new areas of markets. As a future security professional, I want to take the techniques of a ethnographer and apply it to usable security. A way to judge new security policies implemented in the work place. It may already be apparent if there is a poor policy implemented in the workplace as many employees will complain. However, ethnography can uncover problems that a design can fix.

This week, we read an academic paper called Norman DesignX sociotechnical systems. This paper showed how designers now face the challenge of designing complex sociotechnical systems. It explains that designers need to be a part of the implementation stage. This is because not everyone processes and understands the same way that others do. This paper also explained the concept of release products using different methodologies. The hacker methodology means that the designer should know the entirety of their products impact on everyone and everything before releasing the final product. In a perfect world, I may agree with that methodology. However, in many times over the engineer or designer will release a product that was used entirely in a different way than it was intended for. The keyword being intended. No one can accurately foresee the use case of their product. Even if they could, designing their product around every possible use case will result in something that is bad at everything. For example, if GM just made one type of vehicle. If GM tried to make a car that is comfortable but sporty, small and economical, Burly with a lot of torque for pulling, Low to the ground for handling while being able to go off road. That will result in one really bad vehicle, but it takes into account every possible use case that someone might use it for. That just wont work. Therefore, GM makes economical cars, comfy cars, sporty cars, trucks, etc. Designing your product needs to be for a specific use case. 

One interesting topic that was brought up, was the fact that people tend to engineer systems and services by breaking them down into components. Components that are usually responsible for 1 process, and usually don’t have more than a linear relation with the other components of the system. Because of this, ideas or possible designs that don’t meet most peoples thinking process are thrown out. I have a hard time materializing that statement. I don’t know how to quantify which ideas were amazing but had to be thrown out because it didn’t fit our way of thinking. The issue with this argument is for something to be widely used and adopted, it needs to be understood by many on how it operates. Think of vehicles or open source programs, if only a few people knew how to work on cars because they were so complex, no one would have them. If only a few people could work on a open source program, that program wouldn’t exist or it would be very barebones. Complex products and services need to be made of components; they need to be modular so everyone can understand. Systems also must be continuously updated to keep up with new technology, or it will be unusable.
